## A01:2021 - Broken Access Control
<p>- Broken access control enforces a policy that you are not allowed to act outside of intended permissions.
these can be for example bypassing access control checks by modifying the URL, or the HTML page. These
are all things that require to have a permission.</p>
<p>- This policy is made an official thing, because it prevents attackers from modifying, manipulating or
deleteing data and not take over systems. Some ways to prevent these breaches is by creating alarms when
there are too many wrong log in trys, so that the system knows its somebody trying to manipulate the system.
Also denying by default, which denies everything that has not explicitly deemed allowable.</p>

### Question?
<P>Are there specific people that monitor these kinds of systems and what are their names? 
Assessing the broken access seems interesting.</P>

## A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration
<P>- Security misconfigurations are basically security weaknesses that are caused by conigurationstha may be
badly made. They usually make the apps and such easier targets for attackers.for example there can be software, that
is outdated or there can just be simple missing security systems or they may be falsely configured. Unnecessary 
ports can also make the app a liability.</P>
