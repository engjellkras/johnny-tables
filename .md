## A01:2021 - Broken Access Control
<p>- Broken access control enforces a policy that you are not allowed to act outside of intended permissions.
these can be for example bypassing access control checks by modifying the URL, or the HTML page. These
are all things that require to have a permission.</p>
<p>- This policy is made an official thing, because it prevents attackers from modifying, manipulating or
deleting data and not take over systems. Some ways to prevent these breaches is by creating alarms when
there are too many wrong log in trys, so that the system knows its somebody trying to manipulate the system.
Also denying by default, which denies everything that has not explicitly deemed allowable.</p>

### Question❓
<P>Are there specific people that monitor these kinds of systems and what are their names? 
Assessing the broken access seems interesting.</P>

## A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration
<P>- Security misconfigurations are basically security weaknesses that are caused by conigurationstha may be
badly made. They usually make the apps and such easier targets for attackers.for example there can be software, that
is outdated or there can just be simple missing security systems or they may be falsely configured. Unnecessary 
ports can also make the app a liability.</P>
<p>- Same as broken access control, the configs are managable, under the right people and system. If you dont manage them,
they become a liability. A automated system tat could check if the configurations are up to date coul prevent this.</p>

### Question❓
<p>How easy is it to manipulate some configs that are not up to date?</p>

## A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components
<p>- Vulnerable and Outdated Component touch on the same subject as misconfiguration. This dives more deeply to what could make you
vulnerable to attacks. For example if you do not scan regularly for updates, that could make you vulnerable. Also basic and regular 
check ups for UI:s and OS:sses.</p>
<p>- Preventing this happens by at the very least regular check ups, and also removing unnecessary and old unused systems.
This helps with delegating the old malware, and not letting it become a vulnerability. </p>

### Question❓
<p>Is it possible to make a system so unvulnerable that nobody could ever breach it?</p>

## A03:2021 - Injection
<p>- The way that i understand it is that injection is data related encryption. It works when untrusted data gets 
sent into a interpreter, and they use it as a command. This could be for example a SQL or NoSQL injection, which happen
to be the most common ones.</p>
<p>- Some ways to prevent these from happening would be by using safe API, which avoids using the interpreter entirely (A03, Injection).
You could also escape special characters using a escape syntax.</p>

### Question❓
<p>Can the hackers disguise themselves by using a narrative that they are a worker and use data that seems legit?</p>

##  xkcd 327: Exploits of a Mom
<p>- This page has hacking related comics, which were made by a young student showcasing his skill 
and trying to meet new people. Inthis comic you can see the mother getting a call from her sons school.
They are telling her that they are having problems with the computers and they ask the lady did she
name her kid Robert'); DROP TABLE Students;--? which is a command in SQL that wil delete every students
tables and the school admin is pissed off at her to which she replies "I hope you've learned to sanitize
you data inputs".</p>

## Comment❗
<p>This page seems really cool and i like the fact that little bobby tables is used as a name for SQL Injections.</p>

## Webgoat
<p>I could not download Webgoat in to my Linux and i tried to use different methods but it still did not work. I did not have the courage to 
  Download the Webgoat to my windows. Did anybody else have the same problem? I thought about asking Tero in the next class about this issue. Hopefully its fixable.
Hypothetically though, this is how i would have done it. I woul follow the commands from teros site, and then update the Linux.</p>
  
## Portswigger Labs: Lab: SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data
<p>Unfortunately i was not able to get this task to work. I found it extremely hard to test without clear instructions, knowing that i am an complete starter.
Also did not know if doing this task was legal or not. Hypothetically if i would have done this task, this is how i would have done it. I would open the
Developer tools and go tothe network section. After that i would find the product category and try to change it. I would modify the WHERE clause to always
print out true,which would open the hidden messages.</p>

## SQL Zoo
<p>SELECT 0 1. SUBTASK: I did the tasks SELECT 0 basics and from the 2 SELECT 2 subtasks. Below you can see screen shots from the tasks.</p>
<p>In this task we can see that we have a system that finds the specific population of people from certain countries.</p>

<p>SELECT 0 3. SUBTASK: Here we change the numbers in between so that they find the countries that are ony between our numbers.</p>

<p>SELECT 1 1. SUBTASK: Here every column is already in place so everything was correct already.</p>

<p>SELECT 1 2. SUBTASK: In this one we had to change the count to 2 million and make it greater than or the same.</p>
